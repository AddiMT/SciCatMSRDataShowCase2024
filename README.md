### SciData Dataset: Cataloging Scientific Software from 131 Million Repositories - A Comprehensive Dataset of 350K Projects

The proliferation of open-source scientific software for science
and research presents opportunities and challenges. Our dataset
and paper address the critical need to curate a significant corpus of
scientific and research software repositories. Our approach involves
selecting projects from a pool of 131 million repositories from
the expansive World of Code data source followed by extracting
and analyzing README.md files with the assistance of Open AIâ€™s
advanced large language models and classifying these repositories,
with a specific focus on software for scientific applications, projects
associated with research, and research support software. The SciCat
dataset is poised to be a valuable resource for conducting studies
on software relevant to science, shedding light on emerging trends,
prevalent practices, and prevalent challenges in scientific software
development. In addition, it includes data that can be connected
back to the World of Code, Github, and other repositories and
provides researchers with the basis for any number of comparative
studies. Scientific versus nonscientific software.

Description:
The provided dataset includes several columns with various types
of information. Each row in the dataset represents a unique project.
The details of the columns can be seen in Table 1. Finally, our
dataset is available online in the form of a Pickle file (in the repo: SciCatDataset.tar.gz) and Certain
statistics are shown in Table 2.
